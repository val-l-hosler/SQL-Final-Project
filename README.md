# SQL-Final-Project

This is my final project for INFSCI 1500, Database Management. I designed, populated, and wrote queries for a hair salon's database.

### ðŸ§° Tech Stack 
1. SQL

### :memo: The project had the following specifications:

1. Database design
    * Identify a real-world problem and provide a solution that requires designing a MYSQL relational database. Whatever problem you choose it must have enough complexity so that your database would contain at least 10 tables.

2. List of questions
    * Provide at least 10 meaningful questions that an end user can ask of your data.  
    * You must provide an SQL SELECT query with every question - the query that answers that question.  
    * You must have at least one of each of the following query clauses represented in your queries. Explain how the answer to the query would add value. 
      * Single table SELECT
      * INNER JOIN
      * LEFT JOIN
      * At least two queries using different aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, SUM, AVG, COUNT)
      * GROUP BY
      * HAVING
      * ORDER BY
      * LIMIT
      * Subquery using IN predicate
